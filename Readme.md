The G11 library
===============

The G11 library is intended to be a repository of wonderful & disgusting things one can do with the C11 keyword `_Generic` (see [SC22/WG14/N1404](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1404.htm) and [SC22/WG14/N1441](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1441.htm)).

The only C11 compiler I have that implements this keyword is the LLVM Project’s [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/), version 3.0; tests on other C11 compilers would be appreciated.

I am open to any sort of suggestions for this library.  Discuss any of these techniques on [comp.lang.c](news://comp.lang.c) or [comp.std.c](news://comp.std.c).

(The library’s name follows from Jens Gustedt’s [P99](http://p99.gforge.inria.fr/), which is a repository of the wonderful & crazy things possible with the C99 preprocessor.)
